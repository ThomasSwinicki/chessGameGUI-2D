# chessGameGUI-2D

A 2D Java chess game created in a custom GUI. Initially, players will only be able to play against each other on the same program. 
Future online multiplayer functionality may be attempted. There will be numbers on the board and a list containing the lost pieces for 
both players.

Goals for winter break:
-create GUI for game
-import board and piece sprites for game (opensource or from a grpahic designer friend)
-basic moving functions for pieces, eg: clicking on a piece and then clicking on another square to move it

Lists of desired featured for final progam:
-full board with pieces
-Each piece functions according to its role and upon clicking a piece to move. Spaces on the board where the piece is able to move will be marked until the piece is moved.
-Users can move the pieces by clicking on the piece first and then the square which they wish to move it to or by clicking and dragging the piece to the desired square.
-Once a piece is taken, it will appear off the side of the board on the side to which that piece originally belonged, in order taken.
-Each piece will have their respective chess ranking which will be added to the opposing players "count" each time they take a piece. The difference of these "counts" will be calculated and the player who has the higher "count" will have that difference beside their side of the board to represent that they have the advantage at that point in the game. 
-restrict moves that would put players in check
-castling, en passant, and promotion functionality
-undo feature for offline play
