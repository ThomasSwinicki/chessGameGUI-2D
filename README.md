# chessGameGUI-2D

A 2D Java chess game created in a custom GUI. Initially, players will only be able to play against each other on the same program. 
Future online multiplayer functionality may be attempted. There will be numbers on the board and a list containing the lost pieces for 
both players.

Goals for winter break:
-create GUI for game
-import board and piece sprites for game (opensource or from a grpahic designer friend)
-basic moving functions for pieces, eg: clicking on a piece and then clicking on another square to move it
